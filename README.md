# Walk-2-Wake
Android Alarm Clock that forces user to walk around to wake up

Functionalities:
_ Stores multiple alarms. Each alarm can be set to go off on specific days of the week (Mon-Sun)
_ Interactive GUI: user can pick the alarm time by sliding the clock hands (hour & min) on a clock face
_ Once the alarm goes off, there's no snooze or off button to turn it off. User must walk around until the "walk meter" is full to turn off alarm.
