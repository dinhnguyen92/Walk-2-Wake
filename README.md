# Walk-2-Wake
Android Alarm Clock that forces user to walk around to wake up

Functionalities:
- Stores multiple alarms. Each alarm can be set to go off on specific days of the week (Mon-Sun)
- Interactive GUI: user can pick the alarm time by sliding the clock hands (hour & min) on a clock face
- Once the alarm goes off, there's no snooze or off button to turn it off. User must walk around until the "walk meter" is full to turn off alarm.
- Stores 8 different alarm tones. A different tone is played every time an alarm goes off so user will not get used to the tone.
